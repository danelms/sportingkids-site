            <p>You can make a difference with the young people in our community by offering your time or a donation.</p>

            <h2>Donate</h2>

            <p>Donate or sponsor some of our equipment. Every year we help hundreds of young people to take part in sport. With your generosity we can continue this vital work. One-off or regular monthly donations are welcome.</p>

            <h2>Fundraise</h2>

            <p>Because we are a charity we could not do the work we do without support.  Some ideas for fundraising on our behalf are:</p>

            <p>Take part in a challenge event and have friends sponsor you.</p>
            <p>Organise a pub quiz night.</p>
            <p>Host a cake sale or coffee morning.</p>
            <p>Have a fancy-dress day at work.</p>

            <h2>Volunteer</h2>

            <p>In sport sessions and coaching opportunities here at SportingKids we run a number of events throughout the year.  Maybe you would like to spend a Saturday at the BMX track assisting with a club session or perhaps you would like to gain some event planning experience and work with our fundraising team.  We would love to have you on board.</p>
